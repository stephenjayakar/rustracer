Not a racing program written in rust!

A raytracer that has reached the global illumination stage.

General inspiration was that I could no longer find the latest version of my CS-184 project.

# setup

make sure you have `rust` :Z

## Running with GUI

```sh
cargo run --release --features=gui -- --high-dpi
```

## Mac OSX

```sh
brew install sdl2
cargo run
```

## Windows

I got it to work by following the directions on the rust sdl2 bindings.

however, I got significantly lower performance on my system that is about 2x faster than my macbook.

plus the high-dpi system doesn't work the same as mac osx so things break.

let me know if you get it :)
